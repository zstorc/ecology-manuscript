# This project contains the R script and data files for the multivariate models in the submitted manuscript "Interannual Variation in Climate Is a Causal Mechanism Underlying Year Effects in Community Assembly"

# Running the R script requires the following as dependancies:
  # Packages: dplyr, tidyr, vegan, ecodist
  # Data files: species_comp, climate_df, Seq_YR_Diff

# Data file contents:
  # species_comp: species composition data from the sequential restoration experiment
  # climate_df: climate data from the Konza Prairie HQ weather station
  # Seq_YR_Diff: a matrix corresponding with difference in planting year
